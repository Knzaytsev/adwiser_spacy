One of the most transported goods by both kinds of transport are manufactured goods (25% by rail and 28% by road).
Comparing chemicals and non-metallic minerals, the proportion is nearly the same in both means of transport.
Besides, it's obvious, that both means of transport are equal use for carrying manufactured goods (25% by rail, 28% by road).
Besides, we can see, that both means of transport carry a small amount of chemicals (12% - part of rail transportation, 16 - part of road carrying).
The amount of non-metallic minerals transported by road is twice bigger than by rail.
The amount of manufactured goods transported by road is practically the same as by rail.
The same amount of chemicals and food products are transported by rail (11 per cent).
While the smallest amount of goods transported by road is machinery.
In addition, manufactured goods have almost the same shares for both rail and road shipments.
Manufactured goods both types are popular.
Then follows the amount of manufactured goods.
A big amount of people whos eyes became to see worse.
To sum at up, it is a choise of every people.
Overall, the most significant part of both charts is manufactured goods about 25-30%.
Manufactured goods not fully have the same percentage on both diagrammes.
The most different comparison is the percentage of metals on both diagrams.
A lot of bad-influenced factories are situated in towns with a great amount of people.
Its percentage equals 35%, but in road transporting, metals have only 11% of whole amount of goods.
Manufactured goods were both rather high amount, 25% and 28% particularly by rail and by road.
Approximetely equal shares in both charts take chemicals (11% by rail at 18% by road).
However, in both diagramms equal parts are occupied by manufactured goods.
The first main trend is that last a quarter of whole transported goods by both means of carriage is manufactured goods.
Another noticable trend, which combine both diagrams, is that chemicals transported by rail and by road are more than 10%.
It should be noted, the machinery, chemicals and non-metallic minerals together are for both transportation ways in amount of 30% of whole transported goods.
30 in the evening, special distance between eyes and computer desktop and pauses every 40 minutes in work with electronic devices can help person to live healthy and fit.
The chart also allows to compare amount of goods delivered by motorized vehicles or by rail transport in each category.
The most remarkable parts of the chart show amount of metals transportation and food products by railroads and roads.
It is considered that rapidly increasing amount of technologies integrated to our everyday life is not safe for the people's health.
According to the first line graph, it is clear that both: minimum and maximum temperatures in Yakutsk have the same main trend in changes at this period of time.
In July there is a minimum for both: nearly to 17 and exactly 25 respectively.
To begin with, many countries have connections with each other which they are important for both sides.
Therefore, some countries to send the water in bottles or another types of package to Africans to save their citizens.
Overall, about quarter of good transported both by rail and by road is represented by manufactured goods.
Modern technology may cause both physical and psychological problems.
In conclusion, it can be said that counries must offer opportunities for their own population to buy local goods and services and try to buy or import less things and resourses, because it makes them depended from others.
Similarly, the average pf minimum temperature flactuated between 28 degrees C° and 25 degrees C° with the minimum number of temperature of 18 degrees C° in July.
On the other hand, The line of the grath clearly show that the minimum and maximum in both countier are stabilized and we not see a large increases on deacreases.
The percentage of metals transported by railroads is 35% of all the cargo transported by rail in 2008 in the region, while the amount of metals transported by roads is substantially lower - it is only 12% of the goods transported by roads.
I argue that a substantial number of health problems are related to the utilization of modern technology, and that those problems could be reduced by both increasing the number of health protection measures and the further development of technology.
As a conclusion, it is vital to notice that an increasing use of modern technology could be the root of a significant number of health problems, thich could be solved by both the development of health-friendly technology and use of other means of health protection.
The least temperatures that we can see from the table is less than -40°C and it was in Yakutsk in January when in Rio de Janeiro the lowest temperatures was betwee 20°C and 25°C.
Sometimes goverment produce food for over countries that's why thay need to produce less products for their own needs and this is involve on people who live in their country because they don't have much food as they need to.
And there is a huge amount of pluses.
Watching them we can see the minimum of the temperature in both cityes, also we can see the maximum of the degrees during some month.
Furstly, the average maximum temperatures in both cities are rather different.
To sum it up, I want to say that both points of view have not only advantage but drawbacks as well.
As is given, in Russia the minimum and the maximum numbers of the weather are the same, in January and December, there is about -35 and -40, respectively.
It is easy to see, that these both figures increase and decline slightly, depending on season.
Moreover, in the end of the year these figures in both cities recovered to the begining of the year.
On the contrary, monthly temperatures in Rio de Janeiro show opposite tendencies both in terms of warmest and coldest months and the change rate.
Overall, Yakutsk and Rio de Janeiro are characterised by opposite temperature patterns, both in terms of change rate and highest/lowest maximum/minimum temperature months and seasons.
Import and export are the main processes of the Market; however, same people share belief, that, in terms of food industry, the numbers and amounts of both import and export are heavily exaggorated.
For some nations, the agricultural sector is impossible to establish due to natural factors, others can not produce enough to feed everyone - and both country types, thus, depend on import.
Then both average had a slight decrease to 25°C and 18°C in July and climbed steadily to the end of December, reaching about 30°C and 23°C respectively.
Lots of people think that their own country should produce and deliver the necessary food to another countries.
For this reason we can see a situation when any countries have a huge number of some product and they need money, at the same time other countries need this product and their goverments have to buy it.
The maximum temprature have a frequency from July to August (increasing of 2 degrees) and it is an increase to December of both of these tempratures.
There are some opportunities to decrease spending money and increasing the numbers of workforce.
Moreover, less factories will be in the country that provide food only for people who live in it.
However, it could cause economical problems because there will much less places to work at.
They depend on another countries.
When you buy some products from another countries, we can open something new.
I need to mention, the highest temperatures in both cities are approximately the same.
In accordance to pie charts, the maximum share of goods transportation was represented in different category in both tipe of transportation, in Goods transported by rail with Metals (35%) and in Goods transported by road it was Food products (30%).
Other categories have not significant differences and was equalled for about 6-28%, and persentage differs between number in both categories was less than 8%.
To sum up, these two pie charts demonstrate the different rations in their category, however, these graph have some type of goods, that had almost equal persantage in both the goods transported by rail and the goods transported by road.
The modernisation process has both health damages problems and social-health damages problem, however the negative influences of modern technology can be reduced by goverment and self-care.
The charts compare the amount of goods that was transported by rail and by road.
Overall, in 2008 it was a tendation to use rail way transport in order to relocate industrial stuffs like metals or machinery, while roads were used in order to remove less industrial guilds, like nutrition products or chemicals ones.
Secondly, some instructions should be located behind each gadgets, that will warn about the possible consequences.
Totally, young generation should be restricted in amount of usage computers or internet until particular age.
To sum up, it must be said that the biggest part of goods delivered by both means of carriage are manufactured goods.
If we compare this pie charts we can see that manufactured goods are transported by both means of transport.
All the other types of cargos have a nearly equal shares in both types of deliveries (from 10% to 16%).
It is common knowledge that computers, mobile phones, laptops and another modern technologies are mireas number of diffrent health problems.
An enormous number of people begin see badly when they read electronic books and use another fithens of modern technology.
Above all, both means of tranporting had goods they specialised on mostly.
Moreover, there are another kinds of goods which were not so popular in both ways of moving them, namely, machinery, non-metallic minerals and chemicals.
Chemicals had nearly equal numbers in both cases and it is also presented that road transport moved around 2 times higher amount of non-metallic minerals than rail transition (1,3% and 6%, accordingly).
The pie charts compares the amount of goods which was delivered by trains and cars between countries in Eastern Europe in a year of 2008.
The main goods which were preferable to deliver by a both ways were manufactured good.
To begin, according to two pie charts in 2008 it was unusual to deliver machinery and non-metallic menarals by both ways.
Besides, Chemicals were delivered by both ways with simillar amount of this goods with 11 and 16 percents.
The pie charts depict the amount of commodities transported by rail and road between countries in Eastern Europe in 2008.
It can be observed from the first chart that the metals consisted the large amount of goods (35%), manufactured goods consisted one fourth of all things transported by rail.
Overall, the amount of machinery, metals, food products and non metallic comodities the differed significantly in accordance with forms of transportation, while manufactured goods and chemicals consisted approximately the same proportion in both charts.
However, both rail and road transport transfer manufactured goods and chemicals in almost equal parts.
As for non-metallic minerals, the number of it transported by road is two times bigger than the ones transported by rail.
Overall, both charts explain several types of products: machinery, metals, manufactured goods, chemicals, food products and non-metallic minerals.
Modern technologies have both a bad and a good influence on our life.
It caused by huge amount of devices around us .
While it's certain that some people turn to crime simply because they stumbled upon an opportunity to do so and seemingly get away with it, for a large number of people crime was a desperate, last-resort measure.
Ask yourself, do you really want to lose a chunk of your healthcare, your infrastructure, your defence (unlikely as it is that any state would ever reduce its defence funding), or perhaps your actual income, when taxation rises to cover the costs of keeping people imprisoned - all for the sake of a measure that is both morally suspect and not guaranteed to work?
In contrast, from 2011 to 2013 both developed countries category and the world total investment decreased from 170 to 130 rougly and from 279 to 214 respectively.
Secondly, there are less taxes and charges for companies, making the production of their goods more cheap.
Thirdly, developing countries have fewer laws about the environment and all kinds of pollution, which helps companies produce their goods with less losses.
However, the amount of people using Facebook on their desktop device decreased slightly from 150 to just over 130 million.
Receiving updates is the number two reason for using Facebook, accounting for 39% of Facebook users of both genders.
In my opinion, both views have merit, and the best strategy is to involve both sides to form a balanced, compromise-based solution.
In conclusion, worldwide investment in renewable energy increased during the period from 2006 to 2013 both in developing and developed countries.
The figure which presents the users who regular recieves updates is the same among both sexes.
Other people think that there can be another methods of reducing crime and they can be better than long prison sentence.
In conclusion, we can say that the investment in renewable energy has been growing slowling and then rapidly has fall, both among developed and developing countries.
We can see that amount of users chatting on Facebook using a computer in 2012 and 2013 is practically equal with 150 millions of users in 2012 and about 130 millions in 2013.
Furthermore, in 2006 the level of investment in both developed and developing countries was less than 80 billions, comparable to 2013 with the maximum of 130 billions in developed countries.
